# Authentication_Overflow
This example program accepts a password as its only command-line
argument and then calls a check_authentication() function. This function
allows two passwords, meant to be representative of multiple authentication 
methods. If either of these passwords is used, the function returns 1, which
grants access.

 You should be able to figure most of that out just by looking at
the source code before compiling it. Use the -g option when you do compile
it, though, since we will be debugging this later.
